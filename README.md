# Project name : 
TBIBI app : Bridging Healthcare Gaps with Technology
 
 Healthcare Management and Diagnostic Assistance Platform (I-HMDA Platform)

# Project Description:

The TBIBI app is a web app Platform designed to streamline healthcare access and delivery through a scalable web application. This platform will cater to a diverse user base including individuals, healthcare professionals, and eventually, larger healthcare entities (Clinics and hospitals).

## User/Patient Interface:

- Search and Filter Functionality: Users can search for healthcare professionals based on various criteria such as name, location, and specialty. Additionally. i can add a filtering based on reviews, expertise, and other parameters.
- Detailed Professional Profiles: Upon selecting a healthcare professional, users can view comprehensive profiles containing information such as age, sex, educational background, work experience, and reviews.
- Appointment Scheduling: Users can schedule appointments based on the available slots in the healthcare professional's calendar. They have the option to choose between on-site visits or telemedicine consultations (zoom is enough but maybe a dedicated service).
- Telemedicine Integration: For telemedicine consultations, the platform will generate a Zoom call link for starter and then we can think of something more confidential .
- AI Chatbot Assistant: An AI-driven chatbot assistant will be available for users to describe their symptoms. The assistant will then guide them to the appropriate healthcare professional or facility based on the input.

## Doctor Interface:
- Patient Medical History Access: Healthcare professionals can access their patient's medical history with an AI assistant that summarizes crucial information.
- Image Classification and Diagnostic Assistance: The platform will host a series of AI models capable of classifying medical imaging by technique and body area. Subsequent models will evaluate the images for normalcy and potential disease classification. For instance, an abdomen image will trigger a specific model trained on abdominal conditions. The AI assistance extends to combining image analysis results with medical history summaries to aid in diagnosis and medical report generation.

## Accessibility:
Voice Command Navigation: A voice command feature will be integrated to enhance accessibility, allowing users to navigate the platform using vocal instructions.  And at scale, an ai that can understand sign language. 

## Future Enhancements:
As the platform evolves, integration with hospital management systems, and real-time collaborative tools for healthcare professionals can be considered to augment its capabilities.
